# Data Structures Cheat Sheet
A few notes on commonly used data structures and their time and space complexities.
## Lists
A list is a sequence of values where the same value may occur more than once.
### Array List
| Operation | Time Complexity (worst) |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| index     | O(1)                    |
| printList | O(N)                    |
| insertion | O(N)                    |
| deletion  | O(N)                    |
| search    | O(N)                    |
space complexity: O(N)

### Singly Linked List


### Doubly Linked List

## Stacks (LIFO)

## Queues (FIFO)
